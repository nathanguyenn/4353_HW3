This is an updated version of our app for 4353 prof. Singh. 

It uses expressjs and nodejs to power our static front end (html css js). 
This allows us to create multiple classes and dummy data (data folder) to demonstrate that our data is working.

you MUST have express, nodejs and ejs to run this project.
After you have confirmed those, go to server.js file in terminal, type "npm server.js" and it should launch on localhost:3000.

we uses different ways to connect, validate and establish our data. Since we havent worked on the price module, I will show you how 
to demonstrate our backend is working. 

The backend dummy value is inside the data/users.json file. If you launch on localhost and complete your user profile, you WILL see your data
inside the users.json file. 
Another way to know is when you either log in or create a new account, after you have done that, go to the user icon in the top right
there is a feild to show that your current logged in username is displayed.
